The app starts with my Erasmus experience in Finland. The start screen features a start button and several photos from my time there. Pressing the Start button takes you to the Categories page, where you can select different sections of the app using the buttons provided.

The first button is for the Finnish language. Here, I share my personal experiences and favourite Finnish words. The second button leads to the activities I did during my Erasmus stay. These are displayed in list view and clicking on an activity shows a matching photo.

The next button takes you to my favourite Finnish foods; my personal favourite is salmon soup. You can also use a toggle button to display the recipe. Another button displays my best moments in the form of a photo gallery. Finally, there is a checklist of recommendations for future Erasmus students, such as taking vitamin D supplements, packing warm clothes, trying hiking and visiting northern Finland.
